# Cat's World Tour

"Cat's World Tour" is a vanilla-JavaScript-based app that takes a beautiful cat to different cities around the world.

## Target Users
I wanted to target cat lovers (including those who love cats but don't have one) who would like to virtually let a beautiful cat travel around the globe. 

## Usage
My application allows my users to enjoy the beauty of my cat and high-quality photos of numerous cities around the world as the rotating background.

## Built with:
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Pexels REST API
- Sass
- HTML5

## To-Do's
Some things I'd love to include to improve my app:
- adding names and labels for some of the forms and links for better accessibility
- clearing console log's
- replacing var's with const's and let's
- organizing so that all data is together on top and all functions are at the bottom
